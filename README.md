I  built a movie recommendation system using Python, where I applied collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences 
and viewing history. The project involved cleaning and merging datasets containing movie metadata, ratings, and genres. I used libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and 
surprise to build the model, and evaluated its performance using metrics like RMSE. The system provided personalized recommendations and could be extended with a web interface
for user interaction.
